    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to LumiNap (the "App", "we", "our", or "us"). We respect the privacy of our users, especially children, and are committed to protecting their information in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Google Play and Apple App Store policies.</p>
      <p>LumiNap is designed for children aged 4 and up and offers interactive bedtime stories and mini-games that encourage creativity and focus.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="information">
      <h2>2. Information We Collect and Use</h2>
      <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal information such as names, addresses, emails, photos, or voice recordings.</p>
      <p>To improve app performance and stability, we may collect non-personal technical data, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>device type, operating system version, and language;</li>
        <li>anonymous app usage statistics (for example, number of stories opened or session duration);</li>
        <li>crash and error reports.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These data are anonymized and cannot be used to identify the user. They are used solely for improving the app experience.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="third-party-services">
      <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <h3>3.1 Advertising (Android only)</h3>
      <p>The Android version of LumiNap uses Google AdMob to display non-personalized ads. AdMob may receive limited technical information (such as IP address, device type, and OS version) but does not use it for personalized targeting. All settings comply with Google Play Families Policy and COPPA requirements.</p>

      <h3>3.2 Subscriptions and In-App Purchases</h3>
      <p>LumiNap offers in-app subscriptions and purchases through the App Store and Google Play. All payments are processed by the respective stores. We do not receive or store any payment information from users.</p>

      <h3>3.3 Firebase Remote Config</h3>
      <p>We use Firebase Remote Config to manage app features and content (for example, unlocking new stories or adjusting parameters). This service may collect anonymous technical data (device type and app version) but no personal information.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="internet-access">
      <h2>4. Internet Access</h2>
      <p>The app requires an internet connection to download stories and graphic assets from external storage. Once downloaded, content is available offline, and the app can function without an active connection. We do not store or transmit any user data to our own servers.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="data-security">
      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect data against unauthorized access, alteration, or deletion. All communication with third-party services is encrypted using HTTPS.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="children-privacy">
      <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>We do not collect any personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us using the details in Section 9. We will promptly delete any such information.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="retention">
      <h2>7. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
      <p>Anonymous technical data, such as crash reports, are retained only as long as necessary for analysis and service improvement, then automatically deleted.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="parental-rights">
      <h2>8. Parental Rights and Controls</h2>
      <p>Parents and guardians have the right to:</p>

        <li>obtain information about how and why data are processed;</li>
        <li>opt out of further data collection (if applicable).</li>
